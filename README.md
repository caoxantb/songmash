# Songmash

**Description:**
- Inspired by the infamous Facemash website, written by Mark Zuckerberg to rank Harvard University's female students based on their hotness, Songmash utilizes the main concept of comparing two things together, with songs here being the main target.
- With the application, users can rank songs of their favorite artists. The app randomizes two songs from a set list of chosen artists, lets users choose one over the another, then re-randomizes two others to an infinite point. The users’ choices are then calculated by an algorithm, before being ranked accordingly.
- The tech stack being used for the app:
  - Frontend: Qwik 
  - Backend: Node.js + Express
  - Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
  - Server-side hosted on Vercel, client-side hosted on Netlify.
- For deeper information regarding the applications' functionalities and implementation, you can check this two blog posts I wrote in which I demonstrated the process of building this app:
